  <p>This is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns trying to sink each other's ships.</p>
  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Ships are placed on the grid by default in random positions. In this version of the game, you can drag and drop your ships into the desired positions on the grid, or rotate them for added strategy. Just be sure to follow the placement rules: ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but they cannot overlap or extend beyond the grid, and they must be at least one block away from any other ship in any direction.</li>
    <li>Takes turns guessing the coordinates of the other player's ships. If a player guesses correctly, coordinate gets marked with a hit, if they guess incorrectly, coordinate turns gray.</li>
    <li>The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.</li>
  </ol>
